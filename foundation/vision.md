# PHP Community Foundation


## A Problem Worth Solving

The PHP programming language powers over 77% of the Web.[^1] It's trusted by
some of the biggest names in technology, including Facebook, Yahoo, Etsy, and
Wikipedia.[^2] It boasts over 5 million developers[^3] and 300 user groups
worldwide.[^4] It has a thriving ecosystem of over 325,000 open source packages
with 2 billion installs per month.[^5]

All of this is made possible and supported by a small group of active core
language contributors, framework maintainers, package developers, and user
group leaders. In the spirit of open source, most contribute, plan, create, and
organize without the financial support and backing of a company; they must do
it in what spare time they have.

This is not a sustainable model for the future of PHP and its community. It is
a testament to PHP's popularity and usefulness that it has lasted 26 years
without corporate support. While the communities of other open source
programming languages have created non-profit organizations to support their
languages, infrastructure, and ecosystems,[^6] PHP has no such organization to
support the growth and well-being of the language or its contributors, user
groups, open source projects, and more.

Despite widespread use, PHP has a pipeline problem among leadership at all
levels of its community, from the core of the programming language to user
groups to frameworks, libraries, and content creators. The current bus factor
for the PHP core alone is *two*,[^7] and it may be similar across much of the
ecosystem and community.

There are many causes for this—burn out, lack of interest, changing priorities,
or better opportunities, to name a few—and to alleviate the pipeline problem
and mitigate the bus factor, we as a community must take the initiative to
ensure the future and continued success of the PHP programming language and its
ecosystem.


## Our Solution

We are convinced that a non-profit organization for the benefit of the PHP
programming language community will provide the opportunities to connect
community members and the projects they maintain to the funds and resources
they need to be successful.

In November 2021, JetBrains led the formation of The PHP Foundation, whose
mission is "to support, advance, and develop the PHP language."[^8] The PHP
Foundation solves the bus factor problem for the PHP core by funding core
developers, but there remain myriad opportunities for a community organization
to work alongside The PHP Foundation to support the ecosystem and advocate for
the programming language.

PHP Community Foundation will support the growth and well-being of the PHP
programming language community, user groups, conferences, and open source
projects related to PHP through a variety of programs, including but not
limited to grants, advocacy, mentoring, training, and networking.

To wrap it up, we aim to create a community that supports PHP-related resources 
and the people who drive them. Such examples include, but are not limited to, 
forums, Discord/YouTube/other channels, conferences/meetups, 
and contributors/maintainers.


## Our Mission

PHP Community Foundation promotes the advancement of the PHP programming
language and supports the growth of a diverse and international community of
PHP programmers.

PHP Community Foundation and the global PHP community welcome and encourage
participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance,
and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these
principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and
whatever your background, we welcome you.

PHP Community Foundation:

* Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing development
  of PHP-related technology and educational resources. This includes, but is
  not limited to, maintaining a public web site, offering grants to PHP-related
  open source projects, and providing resources and support to PHP user groups
  and conferences.
* Encourages and facilitates PHP-related research in the public interest.
* Solicits contributions to the PHP codebase and may perform these services on
  behalf of other open source PHP-related codebases.
* Raises funds to support foundation programs and services.


## Our Programs

PHP Community Foundation operates the following programs to aid in fulfilling
its mission. One of the tenets of our mission is inclusion. To foster an
inclusive environment, all members and participants of PHP Community Foundation
programs agree to abide by the PHP Community Foundation code of conduct.[^9]


### Grants

One of the primary objectives of PHP Community Foundation is to create a
sustainable model for the future of the PHP community. One key factor in
sustainability is financing. PHP Community Foundation finances PHP development
and other opportunities through the following types of grants:

* Userland development, e.g., open source development and maintenance of
  frameworks, packages, or applications, especially of those critical to the
  ecosystem
* Community development, e.g., organizing and running groups and events such as
  PHP-FIG, The League of Extraordinary Packages, Larabelles, PHP Mentoring, PHP
  TestFest, and more
* PHP project development, e.g., we work together with The PHP Foundation to
  identify and provide solutions for gaps and needs in funding PHP core
  development, as well as providing funding for the documentation,
  infrastructure, security, and QA teams

As stewards of the PHP community's money, PHP Community Foundation carefully
and deliberately reviews grant proposals to ensure grants are awarded to those
proposals furthering foundation's mission.


### User Groups

User groups are the heart and lifeblood of the PHP community. They provide
opportunities for networking, learning, and career advancement to their
members. Through user groups and their programs, the PHP community continues to
grow.

PHP user groups who sign up to participate in our user group program can take
advantage of our accounting services. By maintaining an account with PHP
Community Foundation, user groups can accept donations and reimburse expenses
from the funds maintained in their Foundation accounts.


### Mentorships

To solve the leadership pipeline problem and mitigate the bus factor, the PHP
community must develop and grow competent software engineers and community
leaders. PHP Community Foundation facilitates leadership growth in the PHP
community through its mentorship program by:

* Working with PHP core developers to identify gaps in core development
  knowledge and finding mentees who can learn from core developers to fill
  these gaps.
* Providing training and resources to PHP user group organizers and connecting
  new and prospective user group organizers with experienced organizers.
* Partnering with the PHP Mentoring organization to serve the community through
  pairing mentors with mentees for learning and growing in general PHP
  development.
* Organizing a regular PHP TestFest to teach PHP community members how to write
  tests for the PHP core, providing a path to core contribution.


### Conference Scholarships

One of the highlights of community involvement is attending conferences.
Conferences present amazing opportunities for growth and career development
that cannot compare with other networking opportunities. Many PHP developers
have acquired better, higher-paying jobs through the contacts they've made at
conferences, and this has lifted some out of poverty.

PHP Community Foundation offers conference scholarships with travel and
accommodation stipends because we want everyone to have the opportunity to
attend a PHP conference.


### Childcare at Conferences

While we offer scholarships to attend conferences, not everyone's reason for
being unable to attend a conference is due to financial need. Many cannot
attend because they are unable to find or afford childcare for the time they
are away from home and family. To accommodate this need, PHP Community
Foundation partners with PHP conferences to sponsor childcare services, so that
conference attendees may bring their families with them.


### Awards

PHP Community Foundation recognizes the hard work and dedication of PHP
community members through its awards program. Community Service Awards are
given to PHP community members who significantly improve the foundation's
fulfillment of its mission. Distinguished Service Awards are given to members
of the community whose long-term efforts have significantly influenced and
shaped the PHP community.


### Continuity

Burn-out happens. New opportunities present themselves. Priorities change.
Sadly, sometimes illness or death takes a community member. These events often
lead to a disruption in a project's or program's ability to continue.

PHP Community Foundation provides a continuity program that allows maintainers
and community leaders to entrust their projects and programs to the foundation,
so that it may provide suitable leadership and continuity if the circumstances
call for it.


### Advocacy

PHP Community Foundation wants PHP and its community to grow and continue to
provide economic benefits and leadership opportunities for years to come.
Building a diverse and welcoming community is key to fulfilling this facet of
our mission. Organizing a community of this size is no small task and involves
a wide range of initiatives and communication strategies, including:

* **phpcommunity.org** – a website to inform and showcase the mission and
  programs of PHP Community Foundation, including opportunities to join,
  donate, apply for grants, get involved, etc.
* **phpc.chat** – a portal to various bridged chat networks to provide a wide
  net for including and accommodating a variety of users and preferences,
  including Discord, Matrix, and IRC
* **phpc.social** – a microblogging and social networking service, utilizing
  the open source software Mastodon, to connect and communicate with community
  members
* **Newsletters and @phpc&#8239;@phpc.social on Mastodon** – email newsletters
  and our presence on social media allow us to highlight the amazing projects
  and activities of our community members, while letting people know how and
  where to get connected to the community
* **phphelp.me** – a community-led website providing up-to-date resources for
  helping developers learn and use PHP with current best practices, as well as
  connecting them to mentors and user groups
* **installphp.io** – a community-led website providing resources and
  instruction for installing PHP in the easiest way possible on a variety of
  platforms
* **phplang.org** – a documentation website presenting the PHP language
  specification and PHP RFCs in a friendly and easy-to-read format


## Memberships and Fundraising

PHP Community Foundation is a member-supported organization, allowing everyone
who uses and supports PHP to join. This model is like that adopted by the
Python Software Foundation.

We will adopt the following classes of membership:

* **Basic members** – individuals or entities who wish to declare their support
  for PHP Community Foundation and agree to our code of conduct
* **Supporting members** – members who make an annual donation to sustain the
  foundation and support the community; supporting members are eligible to vote
* **Managing members** – members who dedicate at least five hours per month in
  support of the PHP ecosystem, e.g., organizing PHP events, contributing to
  foundation projects, running infrastructure, participating in foundation
  working groups, etc.; managing members are eligible to vote
* **Contributing members** – members who dedicate at least five hours per month
  working on PHP-related projects that advance the mission of the foundation;
  these projects can be open source software projects using PHP, PHP user
  groups or conferences, etc.; contributing members are eligible to vote
* **Fellows** – members who have been nominated for their extraordinary efforts
  and impact on PHP, the community, and the broader PHP ecosystem; fellows are
  nominated from the broader community and elevated by a vote of the members;
  fellow members are eligible to vote

In addition to supporting members who sustain the foundation with their annual
donations, PHP Community Foundation will adopt a variety of sponsorship
options, each providing a range of benefits. We will work with the community
and our partners to determine appropriate sponsorship levels and benefits.

Other funding for PHP Community Foundation will come from services we provide,
such as our user group program accounting services. We may also provide
training and certification services in the future.


## Governance

PHP Community Foundation is a non-profit corporation. It is governed by a board
of directors and managed by a steering committee.

PHP Community Foundation is organized and operates exclusively for charitable,
scientific, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of
the United States Internal Revenue Code. The foundation operates with the
intent to have the status of a non-profit organization exempt from federal
income taxation, contributions to which are tax-deductible.


## Our Team


### Board of Directors

The board of directors works to fulfill the PHP Community Foundation mission
through setting budgets, hiring the executive director and other officers, and
overseeing the activities of the steering committee.

Boards of directors for non-profit organizations must include individuals
experienced in the domain they're overseeing, those with non-profit experience,
as well as those who have contacts and access to funding.


### Advisors

The board of directors needs advice and guidance from experienced industry
leaders. While not participating in a decision-making capacity, the advisors
bring a wealth of knowledge, as well as access to resources that may be tapped
to help the foundation fulfill its mission.


### Steering Committee

The steering committee will manage all PHP Community Foundation operations. The
board of directors will charter the steering committee and appoint the initial
committee members. The steering committee will develop their own operating
rules and procedures for accomplishing the foundation's mission, including the
creation of other committees and working groups.


### Executive Director

To scale its operations and meet its goals, PHP Community Foundation will hire
an executive director experienced in the non-profit sector, preferably in open
source software communities. The executive director will report to the board
and serve the steering committee to accomplish the mission of the foundation.
