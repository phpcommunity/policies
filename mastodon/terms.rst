Privacy Policy
==============

This privacy policy describes how PHP Community Foundation ("we", "us")
collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may
provide through the phpc.social website or its API. The policy also describes
the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and
how you can access and update this information. This policy does not apply to
the practices of companies that PHP Community Foundation does not own or
control, or to individuals that PHP Community Foundation does not employ or
manage.

What information do we collect?
-------------------------------

- **Basic account information:** If you register on this server, you may be
  asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also
  enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and
  upload a profile picture and header image. The username, display name,
  biography, profile picture and header image are always listed publicly.

- **Posts, following and other public information:** The list of people you
  follow is listed publicly, the same is true for your followers. When you
  submit a message, the date and time is stored as well as the application you
  submitted the message from. Messages may contain media attachments, such as
  pictures and videos. Public and unlisted posts are available publicly. When
  you feature a post on your profile, that is also publicly available
  information. Your posts are delivered to your followers, in some cases it
  means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there.
  When you delete posts, this is likewise delivered to your followers. The
  action of reblogging or favouriting another post is always public.

- **Direct and followers-only posts:** All posts are stored and processed on the
  server. Followers-only posts are delivered to your followers and users who
  are mentioned in them, and direct posts are delivered only to users mentioned
  in them. In some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and
  copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to
  those posts only to authorized persons, but other servers may fail to do so.
  Therefore it's important to review servers your followers belong to. You may
  toggle an option to approve and reject new followers manually in the
  settings. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the server and any
  receiving server may view such messages,** and that recipients may screenshot,
  copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information
  over Mastodon.**

- **IPs and other metadata:** When you log in, we record the IP address you log
  in from, as well as the name of your browser application. All the logged in
  sessions are available for your review and revocation in the settings. The
  latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain
  server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.

What do we use your information for?
------------------------------------

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:

- To provide the core functionality of Mastodon. You can only interact with
  other people's content and post your own content when you are logged in. For
  example, you may follow other people to view their combined posts in your own
  personalized home timeline.

- To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with
  other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.

- The email address you provide may be used to send you information,
  notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you
  messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

How do we protect your information?
-----------------------------------

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic
between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password
is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. You may enable two-factor
authentication to further secure access to your account.

What is our data retention policy?
----------------------------------

We will make a good faith effort to:

- Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server,
  in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.

- Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12
  months.

You can request and download an archive of your content, including your posts,
media attachments, profile picture, and header image.

You may irreversibly delete your account at any time.

Do we use cookies?
------------------

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to
your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These
cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered
account, associate it with your registered account.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.

Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
--------------------------------------------------

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally
identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist
us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as
those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release
your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law,
enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or
safety.

Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your
public and followers-only posts are delivered to the servers where your
followers reside, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the
recipients, in so far as those followers or recipients reside on a different
server than this.

When you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of
permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your
following list, your followers, your lists, all your posts, and your favourites.
Applications can never access your e-mail address or password.

Site usage by children
----------------------

Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (`General Data Protection Regulation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation>`_)
do not use this site.

DMCA Policy
===========

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and specifically the
provisions located at `17 USC
512 <http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000512----000-.html>`__,
set forth the steps an online service provider such as PHP Community
Foundation must follow in the event of copyright infringement on their
servers.

We believe that the DMCA takedown process is a powerful tool that can
help copyright holders protect their intellectual property from being
exploited. We also believe that the DMCA takedown process is a powerful
tool that is frequently misused to force a chilling effect on legitimate
and legal speech. Our enforcement policy is an attempt to prevent the
worst abuses of this process that we've seen over the years, while still
upholding our legal obligations and protecting copyright holders from
the misuse of their intellectual property.

This is a complicated process, and the law surrounding it is unclear in
many situations. We've tried to make this as readable as possible. If
you have any questions that aren't covered here, please `contact
us <mailto:support@phpcommunity.org>`__ with your questions.

None of this material should be construed as legal advice. We cannot
advise you on how to protect your rights online, either your rights as a
copyright holder or your rights as someone accused of copyright
infringement. If you are in need of legal advice, contact a lawyer who
is licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.

Notification of Copyright Infringement
--------------------------------------

If you believe that someone on a PHP Community Foundation service has
violated your copyright, you may send us a Notification of Copyright
Infringement. For us to process such a notification, it must
substantially comply with the requirements set forth in United States
law. To speed our handling of your notification, please make sure it
complies with the following criteria:

#. Notifications may be submitted to PHP Community Foundation's
   Registered Agent in one of two ways. You may send it via email (no
   attachments, please) to **dmca@phpcommunity.org**, or you may send it
   via physical mail to **PHP Community Foundation, 2041 East St PMB 36,
   Concord, CA 94520-2126**. We prefer to receive notification via email.
#. Notifications must be signed by the copyright holder or the copyright
   holder's designated agent. Signatures may be a physical signature or
   a digital signature in a recognized industry-standard format such as
   PGP. Unsigned notifications will not be processed.
#. Notifications must specifically identify the copyrighted work being
   infringed upon. For instance, if the work is a published book,
   provide the title, author, and ISBN; if the work is a magazine
   article, provide the title, author, magazine name, and magazine
   issue; if the work is available on the Internet, provide the URL of
   the work.
#. Notifications must specifically include the URL where the work is
   being infringed upon PHP Community Foundation's servers. For us to
   reasonably identify the material, you must provide us with the
   complete URL to the specific content.
#. Notifications must include sufficient information for us to contact
   you, including your address, your telephone number, and your email
   address.
#. Notifications must contain a statement that you have a good faith
   belief that the use of the material in this manner is not authorized
   by the copyright owner(s), their agent, or the law.
#. Notifications must contain a statement that the information in the
   notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are
   authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is
   allegedly being infringed.

Your notification will be forwarded, in its entirety, to the owner of
the account posting the allegedly-infringing content. We reserve the
right to make copies available to third parties, such as the `Chilling
Effects Clearinghouse <http://www.chillingeffects.org/>`__, as we see
fit, for purposes of academic study and legal review.

Takedown Process
----------------

When we receive a properly-formatted notice of copyright infringement,
we will forward it to the account owner and provide a limited amount of
time to disable access to the allegedly-infringing content.

If you have received this notice from us, this disabling can generally
be done in one of two ways: you can delete the entry, comment, or image
in question, or you can allow us to set the entry, comment, or image in
question to non-viewable. *Setting an entry's security to Private or
screening a comment is not sufficient to qualify as 'disabling access'
under the law*, as this can be undone at any time.

If we do not hear back from you with information about which option
you'd prefer within the length of time we provide for you to select an
option (usually between 24-48 hours), we will assume that you would like
for us to set the entry, comment, or image in question to be
non-viewable, and we will do so. This will not affect the rest of your
account.

You then have one of three choices:

#. You can accept the allegation of infringement, and state that you
   will not restore the content, file a counter-notification, or make
   further infringement upon the work in the future. If you choose to do
   this, you must delete the entry, comment, or image, if you have not
   already done so. This will count against you for determination of
   'repeat offender' status. If you do not reply to any of our contact
   about an alleged infringement within 10 days of our forwarding the
   notification, we must assume that you have chosen this option.
#. You can state that you do not accept the allegation of infringement,
   but you do not want to file a counter-notification or have us restore
   access to the allegedly-infringing content. If you choose to do this,
   we will not restore access to the entry, comment, or image. This will
   not affect the rest of your account. This will not count against you
   for determination of 'repeat offender' status.
#. You can state that you do not accept the allegation of infringement,
   and let us know that you want to file a counter-notification under
   the provisions of law. If you choose to do this, please see the
   section below. This will not count against you for determination of
   'repeat offender' status.

If you have received a notice of alleged infringement, you *may not*
re-upload or re-post the allegedly-infringing material, unless you have
gone through the counter-notification process. This applies whether you
have deleted the material yourself, or you have chosen to allow us to
disable access to the material. If you do re-upload or re-post the
material, we will be forced to entirely disable your account.

Counter-Notification
--------------------

A counter-notification is a statement, under the provisions of 17 USC
512(g)(3), that you do not believe your content infringes on another
person's rights, or that your use of another person's copyrighted
material falls into one of the protected categories under law.

*By filing a counter-notification, you are indicating that you are
willing to defend your use of the material in court*, if the copyright
owner chooses to bring a lawsuit against you for your use of the
material. This may involve civil and/or criminal penalties. *We strongly
suggest you contact an intellectual property lawyer licensed to practice
law in your jurisdiction before you do this*, so that you are aware of
your rights and obligations under the law.

There are groups that may help you understand your rights and
obligations, including the `Chilling Effects
Clearinghouse <http://www.chillingeffects.org/>`__, the `Electronic
Frontier Foundation <http://www.eff.org/>`__, and the `Organization for
Transformative Works <http://transformativeworks.org/>`__. We are not
affiliated with any of these organizations, and they may not be able to
help you, but their mission and mandate involves educating people about
their rights and obligations under intellectual property law.

A counter-notification must contain the following items:

#. Your signature. Signatures may be a physical signature or a digital
   signature in a recognized industry-standard format such as PGP.
#. The URL of your entry, comment, or image that has been called into
   question.
#. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith
   belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
   mistake or misidentification of the material. This should include any
   reasons why you believe your use of the material is not infringing.
#. Your name, address, and telephone number.
#. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District
   Court where you reside, or (if you live outside the United States)
   that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court where
   PHP Community Foundation is located (currently Nashville, Tennessee).
#. A statement that you will accept service of process from the person
   who provided notification of infringement, or that person's
   designated agent.

Your counter-notification will be provided, in its entirety, to the
person who provided notification of alleged infringement.

Restoration Process
-------------------

When we receive a counter-notification, we will forward it to the person
who made the original notification of alleged infringement. From that
point, the original notifier has 10 business days after receiving the
counter-notification to file an action in court, seeking an injunction
against the use of that material.

If you have provided us with a notification of infringement, and the
user of our service has chosen to file counter-notification, you must
inform us that you have filed court action no more than 14 days after we
forward the counter-notification to you. If you do not, we will
re-enable access to the allegedly-infringing material no less than 10
days, and no more than 14 days, after we forward the
counter-notification.

If you have received a notification of infringement, and you have
provided us with your counter-notification, we will re-enable access to
the allegedly-infringing material, or let you know that you can re-post
the allegedly-infringing material, no less than 10 days, and no more
than 14 days, after we have forwarded your counter-notification to the
original notifier.

If you have filed a counter-notification, you *can not* re-upload or
re-post the allegedly-infringing material until we notify you that the
waiting period has expired. If you do, we will be forced to entirely
disable your account during that time period.

Repeat Offenses
---------------

US law requires us to disable the accounts of repeat offenders of
others' copyright. What constitutes a repeat offender is not defined by
law.

We currently define a repeat offender as anyone who has received five
valid notifications of copyright infringement. Instances where you have
filed a counter-notification, or instances where you have indicated that
you do not accept the allegation of copyright infringement but do not
wish to file a counter-notification, will not count against your account
for purposes of determining 'repeat offender' status. We reserve the
right to alter this definition in the future, at our sole discretion.

We also reserve the right to terminate the accounts of those who, in our
opinion, misuse or abuse the DMCA notification process against other
users.
