phpc.social Moderation Guidelines
=================================

This set of guidelines are followed while moderating the posts and content on
the phpc.social instance (neighbourhood). The instance is primarily meant for
the PHP community, but it is not required to be on-topic. Feel free to talk
about whatever you want, although it’d be nice if there was at least some tech
in it.

This document lists the Code of Conduct that we will strictly adhere to, as
well as general guidelines that are softer. The decision of moderators is
final, but are open to appeal.

Code of Conduct
---------------

*If you believe anyone is in physical danger or doing something that is
against the law, please notify appropriate emergency services first by calling
the relevant local authorities.*

The instance is primarily meant for the PHP community and surrounding tech,
but posts are not required to be on-topic. As long as it doesn't break the
rules, feel free to talk about whatever you want.

Please remember that being on this server is a privilege, and not a right.

The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is
up to the administration of phpc.social; they are here to provide you with an
insight into our content moderation policies.

These policies apply to: posts, profile information and bio, as well as
account handles, on phpc.social.

This is a living document, and updates to it will be made if necessary.

#. The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline,
   and may result in account suspension upon repeated violations:

   #. More than one automated post per hour or four per day, excluding posts
      with a visibility of "unlisted" or "followers only".

      they are marked "This is a bot account" in account settings and all
      posts have a visibility of "unlisted" or "followers only."
   #. Persistent trolling, and posts to test the limits of moderation
   #. Promotion of scams (including cryptocurrency and NFTs) or known
      misinformation/disinformation campaigns, such as anti-vaccination or

   punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service. This
   includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviours:

      requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist,
      regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed

      personal, or private data without express permission (informally called
      doxing or dropping dox)
   #. Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or
      discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user
      to cease and desist (informally called brigading or dogpiling)

These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves
the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any
reason, except as limited by law.

Moderation Procedures
---------------------

Cross-Instance Moderation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, a few notes on how cross-instance moderation works:

#. If a remote user is reported from our instance, the report is immediately
   forwarded to the home of the remote user.

#. Suspension of a remote user only makes them invisible from, and unable to
   react to, users on our instance.

#. Any moderation actions we take with regard to a remote user are not relayed
   back to that user’s home instance.

#. Our view of remote users does not include any information (email, IP
   address, etc.) that would allow us to proactively block that user from
   interacting with our instance outside the context of the account they’re
   currently on.

With that said, if user A on our instance reports user B on another instance
for harassment/hate speech or similar-tier offences, moderators can and should
take proactive action comparable to if the harassment had been directed at a
user on our instance, even if the reported user has had no interactions with
our instance (including follows in either direction). So if the remote user’s
feed is exclusively hate speech, suspend that user.

Proactive vs. Reactive Moderation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Moderators are not obligated, as part of their role, to actively seek out
accounts or posts that break our rules or would result in a report.
Moderators, like any user of our instance, can use reporting functionality for
bad actors that they see during their own use of the platform, and can even
take moderation actions directly without going through the report system if
they see something sufficiently egregious, though in those cases moderators
should post in Discord with what they've done as an audit trail on top of the
one built into Mastodon.

With that said, moderators’ primary duty is to assist in resolving reports
made by other users in a timely and consistent manner. This means that the
role of a moderator is primarily reactive rather than proactive, and we’re
knowingly making the tradeoff of catching things quickly to balance workload
on a fully-volunteer moderation staff.

Best Practices
--------------

This section contains a set of guidelines on how to best use this instance.
They include suggestions for when to use Content Warnings. (Mostly copied from
https://blog.chaos.social/rules):

We ask users on phpc.social to keep the following guidelines in mind, in order
to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. Forgetting about them is
not as serious as breaking the instance rules, but repeated malicious
unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like
breaking a rule.

- Use content warnings liberally, especially for topics that are potentially
  disturbing or controversial, or that make life harder for people struggling
  with addiction or trauma, but also for spoilers.
- Set the right language for your posts. By default Mastodon will use the
  interface language to attach to your posts, but if you (for example) have
  set that to English, and you post in German, then the posts will have
  "English" attached to them, and translations don’t work.
- Add descriptions to images and videos.
- Provide credit for creative works that are not your own.
- Don't be a reply guy – uninvited comments about another user’s personal
  choices, lifestyle, or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered
  harassment.
- In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you’re talking
  to. Don’t escalate.
